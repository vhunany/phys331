    "### Questions from Problem 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **To which root do the initial guesses converge?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For the initial guesses x_1 = (1.01, 0.01), x_2 = (-0.51, 0.866), and x_3 = (-0.51, -0.866):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - x_1 = (1.01, 0.01) should converge to the root z_1 = 1 (corresponding to (1, 0) in the complex plane).\n",
    "   - x_2 = (-0.51, 0.866) should converge to z_2 = e^(2*pi*i/3), which corresponds to (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n",
    "   - x_3 = (-0.51, -0.866) should converge to z_2 = e^(4*pi*i/3), which corresponds to (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In how many iterations does each initial guess converge for a tolerance of 10^-3?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The number of iterations depends on how far the initial guess is from the actual root. Based on typical behavior for Newton-Raphson methods x_1, x_2 = (-0.51, 0.866), x_3 = (-0.51, -0.866) should converge in the same number of iterations since the starting points are very close to the actual root, and thus the solution is within the tolerance after just one iteration (tested value in code and recieved one iteration). If we instead take something like (âˆ’0.6,0.9), the number of iterations goes up becuase it is further away from the roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do your results change for a tolerance of 10^-6?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   With a stricter tolerance of 10^-6, the method will require more iterations to achieve the desired precision. This is the case as when we run the code with x_1, the number of iterations is now 2. When we run the code with x_2 and x_3 we also recieve 2 iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Set of Initial Guesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next set of initial guesses x_4 = (-0.1, -0.866), x_5 = (0.2, -0.866), and x_6 = (0.51, 0.866):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **To which root do they converge?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - x_4 = (-0.1, -0.866) should converge to z_3 = e^(4pi*i / 3), which corresponds to (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n",
    "   - x_5 = (0.2, -0.866) should also converge to z_3 = e^(4pi*i / 3).\n",
    "   - x_6 = (0.51, 0.866) should converge to z_2 = e^(2pi*i / 3), which corresponds to (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In how many iterations does each initial guess converge for a tolerance of 10^-3?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - x_4, x_5, and x_6 are relatively close to their respective roots, so they should converge in 4, 6, and 7 iterations respecitvely. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do your results change for a tolerance of 10^-6?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   As with the previous set of guesses, stricter tolerance will result in more iterations. For x_4, x_5, and x_6 we recieved 5, 6, 7 iterations respecitvely.\n"
