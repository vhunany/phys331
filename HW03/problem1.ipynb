When delta is around 10^-4 or 10^-5, especially with 16-bit precision, the result probably won’t be exactly 1.0 because of rounding errors piling up. The 64-bit version can handle smaller delta values more accurately, while the 16-bit version will start to show noticeable errors sooner."

    "\n",
    "To figure out when the error message pops up, I ran a few tests with super small values of delta. The basic idea is that for very small values, the floating-point type can't actually represent the number accurately—it just becomes zero at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown:\n",
    "16-bit float: The smallest non-zero value it can handle is around 5.96e-08. Anything smaller than that turns into zero.\n",
    "32-bit float: Can go much smaller—down to around 1.18e-38.\n",
    "64-bit float: This one can handle ridiculously tiny values like 2.22e-308.\n",
    "What I Tested\n",
    "I tried a couple of small values of delta (1e-08 and 1e-09) to see when the error message would appear. Here’s what happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing for delta = 1e-08:\n",
    "\n",
    "For 16-bit, I got the error: delta = 0.0 because 1e-08 is too small for it to represent. It just rounds it down to zero. So, no sum for 16-bit.\n",
    "32-bit was fine with this value, but I noticed the sum wasn’t exactly 1. It gave me 0.25, which is way off—probably because of rounding errors after adding it a bunch of times.\n",
    "64-bit nailed it with a sum of 1.0000000022898672, which is really close to 1, but still not perfect because of minor floating-point precision loss.\n",
    "Testing for delta = 1e-09:\n",
    "\n",
    "16-bit threw the same error again (delta = 0.0), meaning this value is way too small for 16-bit.\n",
    "For 32-bit, this was also too small, and I didn’t get a result—it likely hit the same precision limit as the 16-bit did.\n",
    "64-bit handled it fine but with a tiny bit of error, giving me 1.000000082740371.\n",
    "Why This Makes Sense\n",
    "The reason for these errors is that each floating-point type has a limit on how small a value it can store before rounding it to zero. Once that happens, any calculations using that \"zero\" value will be totally off (or cause an error). Smaller delta values hit those limits for 16-bit and even 32-bit floats pretty quickly, but 64-bit floats can handle really tiny numbers before rounding issues start to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for 16-bit floats, values below 5.96e-08 will give you errors, 32-bit handles things down to 1.18e-38, and 64-bit can work with insanely small numbers down to 2.22e-308. "
