    "*TThe base cases are the two lowest values in the sequence: 0 and 1. This is because the sequence builds on these values, where the succeeding values are derived by adding 0 to 1, 1 to 1, and so on. Let's say that the base case was 3 and 4. Then the resulting sequence would be 3, 4, 7, 11, and so on. As we can see it does not match the original Fibonacci sequence. Furthermore, in a recusive scenario, becuase we are calling fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2), these function calls will go on and return negative values which would result in incorrect values and disrupt the sequence.*\n",
